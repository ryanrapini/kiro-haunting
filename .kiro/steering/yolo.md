We want to ship our app by tomorrow. to do this we want to cut corners. Avoid writing any sort of unit tests and keep documentation terse and accurate. 

When choices are to be made, suggest the simplest path to a deployed app.

In documentation, avoid describing future tasks or how state has changed since our last commit and instead focus on exactly how the code functions right now.
